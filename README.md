This project implements a basic chatbot using Streamlit, designed to serve as a foundation for more advanced agentic behavior in the future. Streamlit is used to create an interactive and user-friendly chat interface, while the API key is securely managed using environment variables to ensure safety and good development practices. The chatbot persists conversational memory across app restarts by storing relevant data in a JSON file. Within counterbot.py, the system tracks the number of user queries, stores the most recent questions, and triggers interventions once a predefined threshold is reached. As part of these interventions, Gemini is used to dynamically generate quiz questions related to the topic being discussed, reinforcing user engagement and learning. Additionally, timebot.py records each user query along with its timestamp and is responsible for quizzing the user after a fixed delay of 10 minutes, enabling time-based interactions and spaced reinforcement.

For the end-term phase, the project was extended to move beyond a simple chatbot and explore more meaningful learning interactions. The file socratic_bot.py introduces a Socratic-style chatbot that focuses on asking guiding questions instead of directly giving answers. This approach encourages users to think through problems on their own rather than passively consuming explanations. The chatbot also stores conversation history in a local JSON file and uses this history as context for future responses, allowing it to maintain continuity and respond more thoughtfully over time instead of treating each query as isolated.

Alongside this, spaced_repetition_bot.py adds a level-based spaced repetition system to support long-term learning. Each question is stored with a difficulty level and a scheduled review time, which is updated based on how well the user answers during reviews. Correct responses push the topic further into the future, while incorrect ones bring it back for earlier revision. These ideas are brought together in fusionbot.py, which combines normal chat, an optional Socratic mode, and automatic creation of reviewable learning items from conversations. Together, these additions turn the original chatbot into a simple adaptive tutoring system that blends conversational guidance with time- and performance-based reinforcement.
