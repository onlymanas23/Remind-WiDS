This project implements a basic chatbot using Streamlit, designed to serve as a foundation for more advanced agentic behavior in the future. Streamlit is used to create an interactive and user-friendly chat interface, while the API key is securely managed using environment variables to ensure safety and good development practices. The chatbot persists conversational memory across app restarts by storing relevant data in a JSON file. Within counterbot.py, the system tracks the number of user queries, stores the most recent questions, and triggers interventions once a predefined threshold is reached. As part of these interventions, Gemini is used to dynamically generate quiz questions related to the topic being discussed, reinforcing user engagement and learning. Additionally, timebot.py records each user query along with its timestamp and is responsible for quizzing the user after a fixed delay of 10 minutes, enabling time-based interactions and spaced reinforcement.
